TEST NOTES

5:40 PM 12/10/2023 - Launched runTodoListRestAPI-1.5.2.jar using Terminal and opened up the API documentation at “http://localhost:4567”. We are using an API HTTP call software called Insomnia.

5:41 PM 12/10/2023 - To start off, we sent a POST call to “http://localhost:4567/projects” with a JSON body consisting of booleans: active and completed, as well as Strings: description and Title. In return, we got 201 HTTP status (CREATED) with an identical JSON body as our input and also an ID.

5:42 PM 12/10/2023 - We then sent a POST HTTP call to the same link with the a JSON body which only designates a String: description. Once again we got a 201 HTTP status (CREATED), as the API created a project with the same description we gave as input, as well as default values ("" for Strings, False for booleans) for the other fields. 

5:42 PM 12/10/2023 - We then sent a POST call with a JSON body which only designated a String: title. We got a 201 HTTP status (CREATED), as the API created a project with the same title we gave as input, as well as default values for the other fields.

5:43 PM 12/10/2023 - Sent a POST call with only a boolean: active. Once again we got a 201 HTTP status (CREATED) and the API created a project with the same boolean we gave for active, as well as default values for the other fields.

5:43 PM 12/10/2023 - Sent a POST call with only a boolean: completed. We got a 201 HTTP status (CREATED) as the API created a project with the same boolean we gave for completed, as well as default values for the other fields.
